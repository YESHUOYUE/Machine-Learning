# Definition
1.Arthur Samuel(1959): Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

2.Tom Mitchell(1998): A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
### Supervised learning
	processed or labeled dataset
### Unsupervised learning
	unprocessed dataset

# First Algorithm——Linear regression(线性回归) with one variable
## The Discription of the Model
Supervised Learning: Given the "right answer" for each example in the data.

Regression Problem: Predict real-value output.

Notation:
	
	m = Number of **training examples**
	
	x's = "input" variable/features
	
	y's = "output" variable/"target" variable
